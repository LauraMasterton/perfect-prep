## Design
### Colour Scheme
![Perfect Prep Website Colour Palette](docs/coolorscolourpalette.png)
The website uses a colour palette created using the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.
### Typography
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to embed the code for the font families selected.
[Fontjoy](https://fontjoy.com/) was the website used to select complimentary font families. 

[Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) was used for the logo with the font weight of 800. It is a sans-serif font and is easy to read on all device sizes. It is simple and clear but it is not formal. This sets the tone for the website. As it is an online community with a focus around a specific topic.

[Montserrat-Alternates](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat+Alternates) was used for the headings and subtitles. It is a sans serif font and considered a sister font to the 'normal' Montsterrat yet the 'Alternate' family has many unique letterforms. This means that the font is familiar but the unique style adds a sense of fun and creaativity.

[Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) is the font used in the body text of the website. 

### Features
The website consists of three pages. 
1. Home.
2. Recipes.
3. Contact.

* All pages on the website have the following features:
* Responsive navigation bar;
On a mobile device (screen sizes of) the menu is a 'hamburger' menu which upon clicking shows a dropdown menu showing "Home", "Recipes" and "Contact".  This was implemented to give a minimalist look and to prevent overcrowding if the site owner decides to add more links in future.  The page the user selects will change to a font weight of 800 to indicate where they are on all screen sizes.
On screen sizes of - the three links are in the same order from light to right placed horizontally. This was to utilise the available space in the header as the logo is a text based only. However, if more links are to be added in future there is space and the code is available for the smaller screen to use a 'hamburger' menu if this becomes overcrowded in future.  
The user is alerted to the links they are hovering over by a change to the colour text on larger screen sizes.

* A footer which contains social media links for Facebook, 'X' (formerly twitter') and Instagram. Recognisable socia media icons were used in place of text as this is what users expect. 

1. **Home**
- The home page is split into two distinct sections. The first section is a hero image with a heading which directly states what the website is about - "Meal Prep Recipes" and a subsequent tagline "Quick, Healthy and Tasty". This ties in with the minimalist aesthetic of the website. The heading font sets the tone for additional headings and subheadings throughout the website for continuity. 
- The second section is an "about us" section with a grid like structure to address what users queries may be when first visiting the site.  There are currently 6 blocks that are arranged vertically on mobile screens and expand into two columns with 3 blocks each side on larger screens. 
2. **Recipes**
- The recipes page has a clear heading "Recipes" with a short introduction to what the page includes a selection of the site owners favourite meal prep recipes.
- The recipes show the image of the finished meal first, followed by teh name of the recipe and an ordered list of instructions.  Each image is the same size to create a sense of uniformity and on a mobile device the recipes are shown one under another in a single vertical column. On larger devices the responsive images become larger and two columns are created. Currently there is an odd number of recipes and the site is designed to place the remaining recipe in the centre underneath both columns for aesthic purposes. 
3. **Contact**
- A short list of reasons why a user my want to contact the site owner to encourage interaction. 
- There is a simple form with fields for the users: first name, last name, e-mail address and a text box for the user to write their message. Each field has labels for the field and accompanying placeholder text. Every field must be completed before a user can press submit, if any field is missed or not filled in the correct format a tooltip will alert the user to correct the error and highlight the field(s) to be ammended before pressing submit. When the form has been filled and submitted correctly a confirmation page with the values entered will be shown in a new window. (I chose to use the Code Institutes formdump link for the endpoint as opposed to creating a new page so users can see that their data has been submitted.  )
