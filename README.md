## Design
### Colour Scheme
![Perfect Prep Website Colour Palette](docs/coolorscolourpalette.png)
The website uses a colour palette created using the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.
### Typography
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to embed the code for the font families selected.
[Fontjoy](https://fontjoy.com/) was the website used to select complimentary font families. 

[Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) was used for the logo with the font weight of 800. It is a sans-serif font and is easy to read on all device sizes. It is simple and clear but it is not formal. This sets the tone for the website. As it is an online community with a focus around a specific topic.

[Montserrat-Alternates](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat+Alternates) was used for the headings and subtitles. It is a sans serif font and considered a sister font to the 'normal' Montsterrat yet the 'Alternate' family has many unique letterforms. This means that the font is familiar but the unique style adds a sense of fun and creaativity.

[Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) is the font used in the body text of the website.
